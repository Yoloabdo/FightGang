A project i've done as test for internship application in a company 
i've chosen to do it via apple API for network to learn more about how to build a better networking code, without using 3rd party libraries like alamofire for example, it took a lot of time to maintain it and understand it well, but it's worth it, since the same principles can be applied anywhere.   

Next time, networking ain't going to be a problem, at all :)
